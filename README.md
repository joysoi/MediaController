# MediaController
##Overview 
Video controller that shows toast meassages on press which are called through JNI






•	Create an app that depends on a module.
•	The app UI should have nontrival mix of layouts, using RelativeLayout at least once. The UI should scale properly on various form-factors, smartphone and tablet, portrait and landscape. Youtube-style video controls (toast-on-click) will be a good example.
•	The module should contain C++ code using the new Android CMake system. The c++ code can be as simple as returning a string (see below for extra points).
•	JNI Java code should be placed in the module.
